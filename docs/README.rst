Nightfall is a text based role playing game created using Python 3.  The game is inspired by fantasy based role playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons and uses Pokemon style combat (turn based, you can use items, and you choose what type of attack you want to use) as a player traverses through a fifteen room fortress. The goal of the game is to rescue your captured brother from the evil clutches of the warlock Zlor.
